# Security Implementation Documentation

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the ModernAdsManager application to address vulnerabilities and follow best practices.

## 1. Authentication System

### JWT Token Handling
- Implemented secure JWT token storage using React Native Keychain
- Added token validation and expiration checks
- Implemented automatic token refresh mechanism
- Separated access and refresh tokens with different lifetimes

### Refresh Token Mechanism
- Implemented secure refresh token rotation
- Added token invalidation on logout
- Implemented token blacklisting for compromised tokens

### Secure Storage
- Migrated from basic AsyncStorage to encrypted storage solutions
- Used React Native Keychain for biometric-protected storage where available
- Implemented secure data wiping on logout

## 2. Secure API Communication

### HTTPS Enforcement
- Enforced HTTPS for all API communications
- Implemented certificate validation
- Added TLS version enforcement (minimum TLS 1.2)

### Certificate Pinning
- Implemented SSL certificate pinning to prevent MITM attacks
- Added backup certificates for certificate rotation
- Implemented certificate validation failure reporting

### Network Security
- Added network connection type detection
- Implemented warnings for insecure networks
- Added request/response encryption for highly sensitive data

## 3. Input Validation and Sanitization

### Form Validation
- Implemented Zod schema validation for all user inputs
- Added input sanitization to prevent XSS and injection attacks
- Implemented strict type checking for all API payloads

### Data Sanitization
- Added HTML entity encoding for user-generated content
- Implemented URL validation and sanitization
- Added content security policies for WebView content

## 4. Error Handling

### Secure Error Management
- Implemented custom error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information
- Added error logging with sensitive data redaction
- Implemented user-friendly error messages

### Error Boundaries
- Added React error boundaries to prevent app crashes
- Implemented graceful degradation for component failures
- Added crash reporting with privacy controls

## 5. Secure Configuration Management

### Environment Variables
- Implemented secure environment configuration using react-native-config
- Removed hardcoded API keys and sensitive data
- Added runtime configuration validation

### API Key Management
- Implemented secure API key storage
- Added API key rotation support
- Implemented key usage monitoring and restrictions

## 6. Rate Limiting

### API Request Throttling
- Implemented client-side rate limiting for API requests
- Added exponential backoff for failed requests
- Implemented request queuing for offline mode

### Brute Force Protection
- Added login attempt limiting
- Implemented temporary account lockout after failed attempts
- Added CAPTCHA support for suspicious activity

## 7. Security Logging

### Audit Logging
- Implemented security event logging
- Added sensitive action audit trails
- Implemented log rotation and secure storage

### Monitoring
- Added security event monitoring
- Implemented anomaly detection for unusual activity
- Added device integrity checking

## Additional Security Measures

- Added root/jailbreak detection
- Implemented app tampering detection
- Added secure app startup validation

### Data Protection
- Implemented secure data wiping on uninstall
- Added data minimization practices
- Implemented secure clipboard handling

### Session Management
- Added automatic session timeout
- Implemented secure session handling
- Added multi-device session management

## Security Testing

The implemented security measures have been tested using:
- Static code analysis
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Network traffic analysis
- Penetration testing
